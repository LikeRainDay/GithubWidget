### What is Github Widget?
Github Widget is a ligthweight application for 11 different styles of widget to show the following information of github user.  

1. Contributions chart(2D/3D)
2. Total contribution of this year
3. Avatar
4. Motto
5. Followers
6. Contributions of today
7. Current streak
8. Addition of stars
9. Contributions of busiest day
10. Longest streak
11. Trending(daily/weekly/monthly)
12. Received events

After installing Github Widget, there is no launch icon for it. Try to add widgets to launcher and you will find Github Widget there.

### Download
Check the [Apk](https://github.com/Nightonke/GithubWidget/tree/master/Apk) diectory for all versions apks and qrcode pictures.  
Download the current version [here](https://github.com/Nightonke/GithubWidget/blob/master/Apk/GithubWidget_1.0.3.apk?raw=true).  
Or from [fir.im/GithubWidget](http://fir.im/GithubWidget).  
Or by qrcode:  
![Qrcode](https://github.com/Nightonke/GithubWidget/blob/master/Apk/GithubWidget_1.0.3.png?raw=true)

### Styles of Github Widget
The first version supports 11 styles for showing part of the above information.  
Notice that from version 1.0.3, all the widgets support width larger or equal than 4-blocks. But I suggest 4-blocks-width widgets should be used because sometimes images look strange when the widgets are too wide.
